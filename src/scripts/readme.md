1. Explain how you got the HTML, with the correct data, displayed in the browser?
> The usePottery function provided a deep copy of our array of (correct) sellable wares, and the Pottery List function takes that data and is used to generate the HTML that will display on our browser.   

2. In the PotteryList module, when you iterate your pottery, you need to show the evidence of what the weight property's value is for the 2nd piece of pottery. Use Loom to record your browser window with the developer tools open and show those values.

3. The PotteryWheel module has a single function named makePottery. Why doesn't that module have all of the other code in it?

> The modules are all being exported to, and invoked on, our main module; this is where all of our data converges for use.  

4. The pottery shop has learned that there is a set of customers that are willing to buy cracked pottery at a discounted price of $2.50. That means that the cracked pottery should now be displayed in the catalog. Explain the changes that this new business strategy would cause to your algorithm.

> I would need to rewrite my function to include if/else statements that include the cracked pottery at their specific price point and would not be able to filter out the cracked pieces at the beginning, as I have done in my module.

5. In the Kiln module, you have a firePottery() function. You need to demonstrate how to use the debugger to verify the values of the parameters for that function when your code runs. Use Loom to record your browser window with the developer tools open and show those values.

My brain is not working well with me today, apologies that this took so long and is likely not as in depth of a video response as was wanted.  Would love to discuss how to do better, as I still sometimes feel strange using dev tools.  But, let's discuss *tomorrow* please! Brain too smooth.
